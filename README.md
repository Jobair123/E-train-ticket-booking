6. Sequence Diagram
Booking Process:
User searches for trains.
System returns available trains.
User selects a train and proceeds to book.
System shows seat availability.
User selects seats and proceeds to payment.
System processes payment.
System confirms booking and sends notification.
7. Security Considerations
Use HTTPS for communication.
Secure user data using encryption.
Implement OAuth or JWT for secure user authentication.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection.
Ensure proper error handling and logging.
